# Django Task Management with Swagger

## Description
I created this full-stack web application with Django to allow users to manage a personal task list. The application includes features for creating, editing, deleting, and marking tasks as completed. I followed a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach and documented the API with Swagger for easier exploration and interaction.

## Backend Features
Here are the backend features I implemented for the application:
- **Django Framework**: The core framework for the backend.
- **RESTful API**: I created a RESTful API for managing tasks, with CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
- **Authentication and Authorization**: I implemented authentication and authorization mechanisms using Django Authentication or OAuth.
- **Django ORM**: I utilized Django ORM for database interactions and model relationships.
- **Input Validation and Error Handling**: I implemented input validation and error handling to ensure robust API requests.
- **Unit Tests**: I added unit tests to ensure code quality and reliability.

## Prerequisites
To run this application, you'll need:
- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Pip installed to manage Python dependencies.
- A configured database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL).
- Django installed via pip.
- Swagger UI to visualize and test the API.

## Installation
Here are the steps to set up the environment and install the necessary dependencies:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/miguelngansop/task_manager.git
   cd your-repo
